- Reduced `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` from 1000000ms (16.6 minutes) to 5000ms (5 seconds)
- Increased `TOAST_LIMIT` from 1 to 5 for better UX

### Impact:
- Prevents memory exhaustion
- Prevents app crashes
- Prevents device freeze

## 5. Race Conditions and Memory Leaks Fixed in useSourceContent (Critical Data Integrity)

### Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/useSourceContent.ts`

### Changes:
- Added proper cleanup with `useRef` and `isMountedRef`
- Added request cancellation with `AbortController`
- Added operation ID tracking to prevent stale updates
- Added debouncing with `useDebounce` hook (500ms delay)
- Changed from sequential to parallel content fetching
- Added per-source error tracking instead of global errors
- Added proper cleanup for async operations
- Fixed memory leaks from unremoved event listeners

### Impact:
- Prevents data corruption
- Prevents inconsistent state
- Prevents infinite re-render loops
- Prevents memory leaks
- Improves performance with parallel fetching

## 6. Storage System Enhanced with Robust Error Handling (Critical Data Loss)

### Files Modified:
- `src/utils/storage.ts`
- `src/empty-tauri-api.js`

### Changes:
- Added comprehensive error handling for quota exceeded scenarios
- Added permission denied error handling
- Added storage quota checking before operations
- Enhanced mock API with proper error handling and data validation
- Added storage prefix to prevent conflicts
- Added storage migration utilities
- Added proper TypeScript error types

### Impact:
- Prevents silent data loss
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Prevents app unusability due to storage failures
- Ensures data integrity across environments

## 7. Mock Storage API Improved (Development Safety)

### Files Modified:
- `src/empty-tauri-api.js`

### Changes:
- Added data validation before storage
- Added storage quota checking
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Added storage prefix to prevent conflicts with other apps
- Added size limits (1MB per value)
- Enhanced error messages for debugging

### Impact:
- Prevents development data loss
- Provides better debugging information
- Ensures consistent behavior between dev and production

## 8. Security Validation Enhanced (Security)

### Files Modified:
- `src/utils/security.ts`

### Changes:
- Added blocked hostnames list (localhost, internal networks)
- Enhanced URL validation with suspicious pattern detection
- Fixed `createSecureFilename` to detect proper file extensions
- Added more comprehensive protocol validation
- Added hostname validation for security

### Impact:
- Prevents access to localhost/internal networks
- Prevents malicious URL injection
- Ensures proper file extension detection
- Improves overall security posture

## 9. Query Client Optimized (Performance)

### Files Modified:
- `src/App.tsx`

### Changes:
- Reduced stale time from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
- Reduced garbage collection time from 10 minutes to 5 minutes
- Added intelligent retry logic (3x for network errors, 1x for others)
- Disabled refetch on window focus
- Enabled refetch on reconnect
- Added mutation retry logic

### Impact:
- Improves performance
- Reduces memory usage
- Provides better error recovery
- Prevents unnecessary network requests

## 10. MediaPlayer Loading State Management Improved (Stability)

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/MediaPlayer.tsx`

### Changes:
- Added timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Added maximum retry attempts (3)
- Added exponential backoff for retries
- Added proper cleanup for load timeouts
- Added retry count tracking
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

### Impact:
- Prevents infinite loading states
